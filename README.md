# Chess Game in C++

## Project Description

This project is a fully functional Chess game written in C++. It supports two modes:
1. **Two-player mode**: Where two human players can play against each other.
2. **Single-player mode**: Where one human player competes against an AI.

The game follows standard chess rules, including check, checkmate, and stalemate, and has a simple terminal-based user interface.

## Features

- **Two-player mode**: Play a game of chess with a friend in a local environment.
- **Single-player mode**: Play against an AI that follows basic chess strategies.
- **Standard chess rules**: Supports all regular moves including castling, en passant, and promotion.
- **User-friendly terminal interface**: The game displays the board after each move and checks for valid moves.
